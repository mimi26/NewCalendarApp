##Complications/Future Improvements

Figuring out how the data flow between Express and React worked was a bit of a challenge at first. 

Future versions of this app will show weather forecast data for upcoming events. 

I would also like to add the ability to access map data for the event's location so users can find the location they need to get to more easily.

##Contributers

Impossible to list everyone who helped with both moral and practical support, but Jennifer Kaplan helped keep me on track. Kate and Arianan helped solve a problem I was stuck on an entire day. Vince inspired this whole React-Express endeavor by breaking down the process in an easy to understand way.
